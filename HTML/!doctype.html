       <P>I am new to visual communication but, I think of visual communication as a way to show and tell a story and send messages to the world, through colors and actions alongside words. I also think of visual communication as a way to break various barriers in our lives and form emotional connections. My goal is to learn how to how to use creative visual pieces to tell stories and evoke emotions of the people who consume said content by it online, on TV or through other means and to explore various ways that would allow me to accomplish this goal. I want to learn the various means people can use visual communication to accomplish these goals and the thought process that is used when it comes to approaching these methods. I believe these processes are all very important not just when it comes to a career like film or journalism, but when it comes to other fields like communications, marketing and advertising as well. Learning how to go from the brainstorming process, to storyboarding and eventually putting my idea into action takes a lot of work and dedication. If I want to enter any of these career fields, then this will be my best chance and learning opportunity.</p>
