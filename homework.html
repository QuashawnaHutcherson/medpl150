       <p>I use photography and image making in what I feel is a very basic, simple and common way. That is, I use it to show either a particular emotion I’m feeling or to capture a moment in time that I feel is worth remembering; whether it’s good or bad. So many things happen both in our lives and in the world in such a short amount of time that it becomes easy to forget them. By taking a picture of that moment, I feel it becomes far easier to remember some if not all that happened during that time, as well as what we felt in that moment. Whether it’s a wedding or a funeral, a parade or a protest each moment in time has its own emotional weight on us and becomes part of us; so, in my eyes why not preserve as much of it as we can. Emotions are even more fleeting than moments themselves in my opinion. They are constantly changing, we might feel happy about something that happened one minute and then about an hour, a day or even a week later feel upset about it. In a year, we might even forget what we felt at all or the feelings of someone who was with or near us. The human mind and heart can be chaotic when it comes to these things and it can be hard to sort out sometimes, and maybe a photo or created image can help with that.I think I could represent our world at this moment by capturing images of nature itself. Nature is a key part of world and life itself. Our actions affect nature and nature in turn can visibly reflect our actions in how it appears our affects our environment. Our emotions or mindsets can also often be described by using elements of nature and our surroundings. In my view, since humanity is part of nature, then nature is a perfect way to capture our emotions, reasons and actions. Caves can describe various things, like those parts of ourselves that we hide from the public, our blindness to certain things that happen around us, the echoes of loneliness that we can find ourselves in, or the adventurous spirit that each of us have in some way or another. Lightning can be compared to short flashes of who a person can be, someone’s quick wittedness, or moments of great intelligence or happiness. The seasons can reflect a person’s overall personality and what they can be like around other people in their life.  Nature can also be used to give a message; the possibilities seem endless. While that are many other ways to use photos, images and words to represent our world, I personally believe that nature can be one of the most artistic ones to utilize and on some level can be one of the more on point ones as well. To me, it feels like one of the best storytellers of moments in time very much like a photo, with a major difference being that nature, unlike a photo can naturally change with time, while a photo requires man-made alterations.</p>
